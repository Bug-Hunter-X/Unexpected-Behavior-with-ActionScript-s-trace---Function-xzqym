# ActionScript trace() Gotcha

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the seemingly straightforward `trace()` function in ActionScript 3. While helpful for debugging, excessive or improper use can lead to performance problems and hinder the debugging process.

## The Bug
The `bug.as` file contains a function that uses `trace()` to output data. In scenarios involving large datasets or complex objects, the sheer volume of output from `trace()` can significantly impact performance. Also, poorly formatted trace statements can make interpreting the output challenging. 

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.as` file offers an improved approach by using more selective tracing, conditional checks, or logging mechanisms for better debugging. The solution focuses on improving performance and making the trace output clearer.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.as` in an ActionScript 3 editor (like FlashDevelop).
3. Compile and run the code.
4. Observe the potential performance issues or difficulty in parsing the trace output.  Then compare with the solution.
